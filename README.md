# GraduationProject - Multi-PT

This repository contains the files for Multi-PT. The main.py allows to run all different experiments under tunable settings. To start, first install the required packages using the requirements.txt file. Hereafter, unzipping 'datasets.zip' provides the appropriate folder structure. Yet, one should download all event logs and place them in the corresponding folders. This does not hold for the synthetic event log. This one is included as it was generated using the CLDG tool. To obtain the BPIC12W sublog from the BPIC12 event log, one could use the sublog.py file.
