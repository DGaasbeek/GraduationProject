# GraduationProject - Multi-PT

This repository contains the files for Multi-PT. The main.py allows to run all different experiments under tunable settings. To start, first install the required packages using the requirements.txt file. Next, one should download all event logs and place them in the corresponding folders. To obtain the BPIC12W sublog from the BPIC12 event log, one could use the sublog.py file.
